# CDP C# Example

## Compiling and Running

Run the program with
```bash
dotnet run GROUP PORT INTERFACE
```

GROUP is the multicast IP to listen on  
PORT is the UDP PORT to listen on  
INTERFACE is the Interface IP address from the CDP settings

## Extending

New classes for additional data types could be added to collect further information from the CDP stream.
